# Gold Rate Forecasting (Mini Project)

Predicting future gold prices using Python and Machine Learning.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (Web App)

## Project Description
This project builds a time-series forecasting model to predict gold prices. It uses **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models for prediction. 
The results are visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
A Flask web app is integrated for interactive predictions (planned).

## Project Goals
- Learn and implement time-series forecasting techniques
- Visualize predicted vs actual gold price trends
- Build a mini web app to interact with predictions

## Insights
- Forecasting helps investors plan purchases
- Comparing multiple models (Linear Regression vs Random Forest) improves accuracy

## Status
- [ ] Data collection  
- [ ] Model building (Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
- [ ] Visualization of trends  
- [ ] Flask web app integration  
- [ ] README & documentation  

## Future Enhancements
- Deploy Flask app online for interactive use
- Add more advanced models like ARIMA or LSTM
- Include evaluation metrics like RMSE and MAE
